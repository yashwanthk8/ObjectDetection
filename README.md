Real-Time Object Detection with Beep Sound (Web)
This project implements real-time object detection in a web browser using TensorFlow.js and the pre-trained COCO SSD model. When an object is detected, a beep sound is played to alert the user. This project works directly in the browser and accesses the webcam to provide real-time feedback.

Features
Real-time object detection using a webcam feed.
Object detection based on COCO SSD (Common Objects in Context).
Plays a beep sound when an object is detected.
Runs entirely in the browser with no need for a backend.
Technologies Used
TensorFlow.js: JavaScript library for running machine learning models in the browser.
COCO SSD Model: Pre-trained model for object detection.
JavaScript: For processing the video feed and handling object detection.
HTML5 & CSS: To create the user interface.
WebRTC: To access the webcam.
How It Works
The user grants the webpage access to their webcam.
The COCO SSD model detects objects in real-time from the webcam feed.
If an object is detected with a confidence score higher than 50%, a bounding box is drawn around the object, and a beep sound is triggered.
The detection runs continuously until the user closes the browser tab or stops the camera.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Web browser (preferably Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
Internet connection (for fetching the TensorFlow.js and COCO SSD model libraries).
Webcam (for real-time video feed).
How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-object-detection.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd real-time-object-detection
Open index.html in a Web Browser: You can simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser to run the project. No need for a local server setup as everything runs on the client-side.

Grant Camera Permissions: The browser will prompt you to allow camera access. Make sure to grant the required permissions to see the real-time object detection in action.

Important Files
index.html: Main HTML file to render the webpage and load the necessary scripts.
style.css: Basic styling for the webpage.
app.js: The core JavaScript logic for accessing the webcam, running object detection, and playing the beep sound.
beep.wav: The sound file that plays when an object is detected. (You can replace this file with your custom sound.)
Usage
Open the webpage in your browser.
Grant access to your webcam when prompted.
Objects in the frame of the camera will be detected in real-time.
A beep sound will play every time an object is detected.
